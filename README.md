# Emotion Tells What You Need: A Novel Requirements Elicitation and Prioritisation Framework based on Emotional Changes

Abstract
Requirements Engineering (RE) activities are highly collaborative among stakeholders, and emotions of stakeholders during various RE activities are becoming a critical source of information for analysing software requirements. While existing studies primarily focus on static emotion analysis from requirements documents and the impact of emotions on the behaviours of software development teams, the connections between emotions (including emotional changes) and requirements (including requirements elicitation and prioritization) is largely unknown. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a practical framework that captures emotional dynamics during requirements workshops, and helps to analyze the connections between emotions and requirements. The framework includes the detailed instructions for the pre-workshop preparation, requirements workshop, and post-workshop data analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study on a requirements workshop for an online shopping website. The case study produces some interesting findings such as that significant emotional changes often occur during the discussions of high-priority requirements, which verifies the importance for detecting emotional changes over static emotions. Our framework can be used by both software engineering researchers to investigate the connections between emotions and software requirements, and industry practitioners to better identify and understand clients' requirements and their priorities.

Project selection .The first step of our framework aims to select a target project for the case study among different types of software. This step is crucial since it is the base for the research. The main objective is to select a project which can represent typical requirement engineering scenario and ensure the data is generalizable and relevant. There are several criteria for project selection: 1) Project complexity: the project should have sufficient complexity, including multiple components, conditions, and stakeholders to ensure the richness of emotional responses. Therefore, we can have more emotional data to discover the connections with the priorities of requirements. 2) Stakeholder diversity: this criterion is not only limited to roles (developer, clients, project manager, etc.) but also other information (personality, gender, work experience, etc.). Diversity in stakeholder roles and backgrounds can demonstrate a comprehensive emotional response during a case study. 3) Project features: to increase the coverage of the study, the projects selected should cover conventional software such as web sites and mobile Apps, and also emerging software such as VR and AI applications.

Collection of project data. 
The second step of preparation is to gather the comprehensive information for the project. The information should include project scope, information of stakeholders, design documents, existing requirements and communication records. The above comprehensive information provides participants and researchers a clear boundaries for grounds for workshop discussions in real-world scenarios. The rich analysis of stakeholders is conducted to identify the roles, interests and influence of different stakeholders, thus providing apposite data of emotional changes.

Environment setup. 
Setting up an appropriate environment for workshop discussions is crucial for Collection of emotions and the authenticity of experiments. From physical point of view, the meeting environment needs to fit a real-world scenario. The elements include quiet environments with adequate lighting and seating arrangement, such as an office room, for better communication and interaction, prompting participant to get into their role. From the technical point of view, installing equipment such as cameras, microphones, or other sensors to record the process of requirement workshop for future data analysis. At the same time, laptop computer and projection screen for slide show should be also prepared to do demonstration and to do recording.
