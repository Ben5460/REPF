# Emotion Tells What You Need: A Novel Requirements Elicitation and Prioritisation Framework based on Emotional Changes

Abstract
Requirements Engineering (RE) activities are highly collaborative among stakeholders, and emotions of stakeholders during various RE activities are becoming a critical source of information for analysing software requirements. While existing studies primarily focus on static emotion analysis from requirements documents and the impact of emotions on the behaviours of software development teams, the connections between emotions (including emotional changes) and requirements (including requirements elicitation and prioritization) is largely unknown. To fill this gap, this paper proposes a practical framework that captures emotional dynamics during requirements workshops, and helps to analyze the connections between emotions and requirements. The framework includes the detailed instructions for the pre-workshop preparation, requirements workshop, and post-workshop data analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework through a case study on a requirements workshop for an online shopping website. The case study produces some interesting findings such as that significant emotional changes often occur during the discussions of high-priority requirements, which verifies the importance for detecting emotional changes over static emotions. Our framework can be used by both software engineering researchers to investigate the connections between emotions and software requirements, and industry practitioners to better identify and understand clients' requirements and their priorities.
